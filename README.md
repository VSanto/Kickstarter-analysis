# Anaylsis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Review the data to determine the best time to fundraise
Outcome Based on Goals
 -Goals from 0 to 4,999 had above 70% success rate
 -challenge completing the percentage for canceled plays
   -there were no canceled plays.  
     -when I tried to get the percentage I got an error message about dividing by 0
       -I had to switch to an IF statement to have the line populate with a number instead of the error code
 Outcome Based on Launch Date
  -most successful fundraising months are May and June
   --did not find too many challenges when greating this report
 Recommendations
  -Reduce the fundraising requests to under $5,000 at a time
    -this may mean breaking up the larger productions into smaller campaigns to achieve full funding

Data is limited do not know types of fundraising. 
Additional data on types of fundraising would have been helpful in determining what works
